<h1> JDM Car Culture: An Introduction </h1>
<div> 
  <p> This is JDM Car Culture. A ton of people who admire the art of Japanese engineering converge together at a common interest point. At its heart, the JDM Car Culture doesn't really have a solid definition. We have a lot of stuff to cover, so buckle your seatbelts, and lets get started. </p>
<h2> Budgets, and cars. </h2>
<p> JDM cars, or Japanese Domestic Market cars, were created as a cheaper alternative to their European counterparts, often being far more reliable, and much more tuneable. However, Japanese cars didn't have the brand name following that the European cars did, lets take for example the BMW M3 could be a counterpart to the Toyota Supra. Both are RWD sports cars, they both can be tuned and modified well, and they are both really fun cars. Despite this, the Toyota Supra failed upon release, but it skyrocketed in popularity and price in the early 2010's. </p>

<h2> Low-Budget JDM Cars </h2>
<b> If you didn't have much money to spend, these are some of the most popular low budget JDM cars.</b>
<ul> 
<li> Toyota AE86 (ae hachiroku) </li>
<p> The Toyota AE86 was a popular JDM car back in the 80's, and its tuning potential is almost unlimited. Popularized by the racing anime, Initial D, this car was, light, aerodynamic, had a lot of tuning potential, and most of all cheap. It showed that speed was not everything, (because this car was not fast! at all...) it was more of a nimble car, and had better handling, it was more of a drift car. </p>
<li> Honda Civic </li>
<p> The Honda Civic was a pretty cheap car, developed by Honda, and it was popular amongst modders and Tuners alike for how easy it was to customize. Again, it wasn't a very fast car, but it was easily accesible for people to buy, and it was quite a popular car for its light-weight and athletic driving demeanor despite being cheap. </p>
</ul>

  <h2> Mid - To High Budget JDM Cars </h2>
  <ul>
<li> Mazda RX-7 </li>
    <p> The Mazda RX-7 (FD generation, ~1991), was a sports car developed by Mazda and it was a front-engined, rear wheel drive sports car that had a starting MSRP of $31,000. The Mazda RX-7, was also popular for its tuning capabilities, and lightweight, agile, and quick handling demeanor. Unfortunately, not many unmodified examples exist currently, and any unmodified examples that are still up for sale come at a very heavy price.   </p>
<li> Acura NSX </li>
    <p> The Acura NSX was a supercar that was developed by Honda from the 90's up until now. It has a V6 engine making about 270 horsepower, all going to the rear-wheels. The Acura NSX was praised for having an "analog" driving feel that was different from the cars at the time, and it felt more real, and the driver was more connected to the car. The Honda NSX's interior was driver-focused, meaning that everything faced the driver, to make it easier for them to drive, and the Mazda RX-7 also had a driver-focused interior, which was praised by many. The Honda/Acura NSX (they are both the same brand, Acura being a luxury version of Honda), starts at a hefty MSRP of about $170,000  </p>
  </ul>
<h1> JDM supercars: An Inspiring yet Sad tale </h1>
  <p> During the 80's, 90's until now, Japanese automakers have been trying to make Halo Cars, or cars that show of the best of the brand, and their maximum capabilities of what they are able to create. This resulted in many amazing supercars that just seemed impossible to see from Japanese automakers. When you think of Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda etc..., you think of really boring cars, perhaps a Honda Odyssey minivan that moms drive when they need to pick their kids up from soccer practice, or the Toyota Camry, known for being a boring, yet reliable car. Japanese automakers have never been known for anything more than this, however there are certain cars that Japanese automakers have made that stand out.</p>
