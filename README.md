<h1> JDM Car Culture: An Introduction </h1>
<div> 
  <p> This is JDM Car Culture. A ton of people who admire the art of Japanese engineering converge together at a common interest point. At its heart, the JDM Car Culture doesn't really have a solid definition. We have a lot of stuff to cover, so buckle your seatbelts, and lets get started. </p>
<h2> Budgets, and cars. </h2>
<p> JDM cars, or Japanese Domestic Market cars, were created as a cheaper alternative to their European counterparts, often being far more reliable, and much more tuneable. However, Japanese cars didn't have the brand name following that the European cars did, lets take for example the BMW M3 could be a counterpart to the Toyota Supra. Both are RWD sports cars, they both can be tuned and modified well, and they are both really fun cars. Despite this, the Toyota Supra failed upon release, but it skyrocketed in popularity and price in the early 2010's. </p>

<h2> Low-Budget JDM Cars </h2>
<b> If you didn't have much money to spend, these are some of the most popular low budget JDM cars.</b>
<ul> 
<li> Toyota AE86 (ae hachiroku) </li>
<p> The Toyota AE86 was a popular JDM car back in the 80's, and its tuning potential is almost unlimited. Popularized by the racing anime, Initial D, this car was, light, aerodynamic, had a lot of tuning potential, and most of all cheap. It showed that speed was not everything, (because this car was not fast! at all...) it was more of a nimble car, and had better handling, it was more of a drift car. </p>
